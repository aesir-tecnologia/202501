# Task ID: 7
# Title: Project Management CRUD System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement complete project creation, editing, and management
# Details:
Create composables/useProjects.ts for project state management using useState(). Implement project creation modal with form validation using @nuxt/ui v4 Form and Zod schemas. Add project editing functionality with optimistic updates. Create project deletion with confirmation dialogs. Implement project activation/deactivation toggle. Add custom stint duration settings per project. Use Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates across tabs.

# Test Strategy:
Test project CRUD operations with various data inputs, validate form validation works correctly, test optimistic updates and error rollback, verify real-time updates across multiple browser tabs, test project settings persistence.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create project state management composable [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement composables/useProjects.ts with useState() for reactive project state management
### Details:
Create composables/useProjects.ts that uses Nuxt's useState() for managing project state. Implement reactive state for projects list, current active project, loading states, and error handling. Include functions for state mutations, project filtering, and state reset. Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety.

## 2. Implement project creation modal with form validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Build project creation modal using @nuxt/ui v4 Form components and Zod schemas
### Details:
Create a modal component for project creation using @nuxt/ui v4 Modal and Form components. Implement Zod schema validation for project fields (name, description, stint duration, etc.). Add form field validation, error handling, and success feedback. Use @nuxt/ui v4 Input, Textarea, and Select components for the form.

## 3. Add project editing functionality with optimistic updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Implement project editing with immediate UI updates and error rollback
### Details:
Create project editing functionality that immediately updates the UI (optimistic updates) before Supabase confirmation. Implement rollback mechanism for failed updates. Add inline editing or edit modal options. Handle concurrent editing conflicts and provide user feedback for save status.

## 4. Create project deletion with confirmation dialogs [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement safe project deletion with confirmation dialogs and cascade handling
### Details:
Build project deletion functionality with multi-step confirmation dialogs. Handle cascade deletion of related stints and data. Implement soft delete option for data recovery. Add warnings for projects with active stints. Use @nuxt/ui v4 AlertDialog for confirmations.

## 5. Implement real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Add Supabase real-time subscriptions for live project updates across tabs
### Details:
Set up Supabase real-time subscriptions for the projects table. Handle INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE events to keep UI synchronized across browser tabs and devices. Implement connection status monitoring and reconnection logic. Update the useProjects composable to handle real-time events and merge changes with local state.

			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Environment Setup and Supabase Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down environment setup into configuration file creation, module installation, TypeScript integration, and security setup. Focus on Nuxt 4 compatibility and @nuxtjs/supabase v2 configuration patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity due to greenfield project, modern tooling (@nuxtjs/supabase handles most complexity), and clear documentation. Main work involves file creation and configuration rather than complex logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema and RLS Policies",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure database creation around table design, constraint setup, RLS policy implementation, indexing strategy, and TypeScript type generation. Consider performance optimization and security best practices.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity requiring understanding of PostgreSQL, RLS policies, and proper indexing. Supabase SQL editor simplifies deployment, but security policies require careful design for multi-user isolation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "User Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break authentication into page creation using @nuxt/ui forms, Supabase Auth integration, email verification flow, password recovery, and middleware setup. Focus on UX and security best practices.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity with @nuxtjs/supabase handling most auth complexity. Main work involves form creation with @nuxt/ui and proper middleware setup. Email flows add some complexity but are well-documented."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Core API Routes and Server Functions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure API development around server directory setup, validation schema creation, CRUD endpoint implementation, business logic enforcement, and performance optimization. Emphasize security and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to server-side business logic, validation schemas, rate limiting, and proper error handling. Nuxt 3+ server directory structure is helpful, but timer validation and security require careful implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Reusable UI Components and Design System",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize component development around design system setup, core component creation using @nuxt/ui primitives, timer component with Web Worker, modal system, and theming configuration.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity with @nuxt/ui providing good foundations. Web Worker timer adds complexity, but component structure is straightforward with existing design system components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Main Dashboard Layout and Navigation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break layout development into responsive layout creation, navigation setup using @nuxt/ui, dashboard page implementation, user profile management, and SEO optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving responsive design, navigation patterns, and state management. @nuxt/ui NavigationMenu and built-in Nuxt features reduce complexity significantly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Project Management CRUD System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure CRUD system around composable state management, form validation with Zod, optimistic updates, confirmation dialogs, and real-time synchronization using Supabase subscriptions.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to optimistic updates, real-time synchronization, and proper state management. Supabase real-time helps, but conflict resolution and state consistency require careful design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Stint Tracking and Timer System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break timer system into Web Worker implementation, state management composable, start/stop functionality, notification system, and cross-device synchronization. Focus on accuracy and user experience.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to Web Worker implementation, cross-device synchronization, notification system, and timer accuracy requirements. Core business logic with multiple technical challenges including background processing and conflict resolution."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Real-time Updates and Cross-device Synchronization",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure real-time system around connection management, subscription handling, optimistic updates, conflict resolution, and offline/online state management. Emphasize data consistency and user experience.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity requiring sophisticated state management, conflict resolution strategies, and connection handling. Supabase real-time provides infrastructure, but implementing proper optimistic updates and conflict resolution is challenging."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Analytics Dashboard and Professional Reporting",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize analytics around Chart.js integration, data aggregation systems, PDF export functionality, CSV export, and sharing mechanisms. Focus on performance and professional presentation.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity involving data visualization, PDF generation, and sharing systems. Chart.js and jsPDF provide good foundations, but data aggregation and export functionality require careful implementation for performance."
